# Force Table Simulator
***
A Force Table simulator for all of your Force Table needs!

Still in the poof-of-concept stage, this simulator can take an input of up to four known forces to calculate the unknown force needed to create a net force of 0.

## So what's missing?
+ Dynamic handling of more than four angles
+ Line labels (magnitude, degree, etc.)
+ Detection of inputted approximate net-0 force
+ Cleaner drawing methods :) (actually, cleaner code overall)
+ An HTML page that doesn't look like a 3-yea old made it
+ Probably a lot of features, but I'll add more as more as my Physics class demands

## So, uh, any live demos floating around?
Yep there sure is! Checkout [pawlh.github.io/force_simu](https://pawlh.github.com/force_simu).
